  slides.push({ text: `1. Practice

You're about to be presented with several different situations with students based on the selection you made on the previous screen.

After you click "Practice," you'll see your first scene involving student(s) and you’ll type how you'd respond to the student(s) in the moment. Once you finished your response to the first scene, another scene will appear and you’ll type your response to that scene. This process will continue until you’ve read and responded to six (6) different scenes.
`});

  slides.push({ text: `2. Reflect and Discuss

Once you’ve responded to all the scenes, you’ll come back as a group and discuss your responses in the vein of apples-to-apples. Basically, one person will be the “owner” of the first scene and will review the responses to the scene with the group and then select their preferred response based on the group’s feedback and their own preferences. The next person will “own” the second scene and will repeat the process as described above. You will do this until everyone has had a turn “owning” a scene.
`});


  slides.push({ text: `3. Connect to Personal Experience

Once all members of your team have had a chance to “own” a scene, you will debrief as a team by discussing your personal experiences with students engaging in the behavior you selected at the beginning.



4. Return to Large Group Discussion

Once 60 minutes elapses, you will return to the all-school discussion.
